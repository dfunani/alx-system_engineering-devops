# Postmortem: The Great Apache Meltdown of 2024

## Issue Summary:

On a fateful Friday, August 16th, 2024, our beloved WordPress website decided to throw a tantrum and serve up a delicious plate of 500 errors to our unsuspecting users. This digital dumpster fire lasted a mere 30 minutes, but felt like an eternity for those caught in the crossfire.

## The Drama Unfolds:

10:00 AM PST: Our trusty monitoring tools started flashing red like a panicked monkey, alerting us to a significant drop in website traffic. We were baffled, to say the least.
10:02 AM PST: Upon further investigation, we discovered our site had morphed into a 500 error factory. The horror!
10:05 AM PST: We dove headfirst into the Apache logs, hoping to find a smoking gun. Unfortunately, the logs were as helpful as a chocolate teapot.
10:10 AM PST: Suspicions arose about WordPress core files or plugins behaving badly. We started sniffing around, but found nothing out of the ordinary.
10:15 AM PST: Desperate times called for desperate measures. We unleashed the power of strace to spy on Apache’s every move.
10:20 AM PST: Eureka! strace revealed Apache was having a meltdown over a missing wp-settings.php file.
10:25 AM PST: We discovered a rogue "phpp" had infiltrated wp-settings.php, causing chaos and confusion.
10:28 AM PST: Our Puppet overlord was summoned to swiftly vanquish the evil "phpp" and restore order to the realm.

## Root Cause and Resolution:

It turns out our website was brought to its knees by a simple typo. A rogue "phpp" had snuck into wp-settings.php, causing Apache to throw a fit. We banished the imposter and restored harmony to the web.

## Lessons Learned and Future Endeavors:

We’ve learned that even the smallest mistakes can have catastrophic consequences. From now on, we're implementing a strict "no phpp" policy and will be treating our configuration files with the respect they deserve. We're also considering therapy for our poor Apache server.

To prevent future meltdowns, we're beefing up our code review process, putting our configuration files under version control, and adding automated tests to our arsenal. We're also planning to install a panic button for our servers, just in case.
